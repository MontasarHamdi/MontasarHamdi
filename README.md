### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineering student under the tutelage of Hyperion Dev. I am a motivated Software Engineering professional with 4 months of experience in Python, Django, SQL, HTML, CSS and agile development. Within the last five years as a physiologist, I have managed multiple projects in digital health. I worked closely with IT technicians and software engineers to maintain and troubleshoot medical equipment. I was trained to utilise several software applications specific to diagnostic testing.

I am looking to transfer my current soft skill-set alongside my newly developed software engineering skills into the technology sector. I am aiming to find entry level opportunities within the health, wearable technology, genomic, aviation and aerospace technological sector.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently in the process of completing the Software Engineering Bootcamp Scholarship.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, HTML, CSS and SQL.
